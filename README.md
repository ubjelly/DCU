DCU
===

DCU, Derithium Client Updater, is a tool made with a conscious effort to provide simplicity. DCU was built for RuneScape clients, specifically for cache updation. Unlike other cache updaters, DCU requires no programming on the user's part with the exception of referencing the jar.

In order to use DCU you must have an account. To register, please visit http://www.derithium.com/dcu/register.php. The registration process is used to access the admin panel which allows you to create a patch specifically tailored to your client's cache.

Any questions or comments can be sent to Stephen@derithium.com.
